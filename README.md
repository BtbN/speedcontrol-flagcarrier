# speedcontrol-flagcarrier

**ACTUAL README TO BE DONE.**

A server side NodeCG bundle used to receive requests from the [FlagCarrier android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.oromit.flagcarrier). Although it has the speedcontrol name, you don't specifically need to use it with `nodecg-speedcontrol` and it can be ran on it's own.
